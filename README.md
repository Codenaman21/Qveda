# QVEDA - WHERE QUANTUM MEETS CLARITY

---

## Problem Statement
Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as the future of technology — but it remains inaccessible to most. The concepts are abstract, tools are complex, and existing platforms lack intuitive visualization or educational guidance, leaving beginners overwhelmed.
Students, developers, and enthusiasts in India struggle to learn, build, and experiment with quantum circuits in a way that feels interactive and practical.
There is a clear need for an accessible, India-first quantum learning and simulation platform that simplifies circuit creation, offers AI-driven insights, and makes quantum computing approachable for everyone.

---

## Proposed Solution
We simplify quantum computing through an **interactive web platform** that lets users build and simulate quantum circuits visually, without needing advanced expertise.
Features include:
- Drag-and-drop tools to create circuits.
- Real-time simulation and AI-guided insights.
- India-first solution with global reach.
- Empowering learners to move from theory to practical application.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- ShadCN UI

**Backend:**
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- Machine Learning Libraries: Numpy, SciPy
- Qiskit / Cirq / VQiskitAer Simulator

**Tools & Services:**
- Git & GitHub
- IBM Quantum Experience
- Cross-platform quantum simulation

---

## Workflow
1. User creates a workflow by dragging & connecting quantum/classical blocks.
2. The system converts the workflow into executable quantum circuits.
3. Backend runs the circuits on simulators or quantum hardware.
4. Results are processed and visualized in an interactive dashboard.
5. User iterates, refines, or exports the workflow/code for better performance or new experiments.

---

## Future Expansion
- Integration with classical AI/ML models for hybrid quantum-classical workflows.
- Expansion into industry-specific modules (finance, pharma, logistics, materials science).
- Marketplace for quantum algorithms where developers can share and monetize workflows.
- Enterprise-ready collaboration features for multi-user workflow design and execution.
- Support for multi-cloud & cross-platform quantum backends (IBM, Google, AWS, IonQ, Rigetti).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/qveda.git
cd qveda
````

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
